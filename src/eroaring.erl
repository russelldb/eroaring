%% API

% NIF functions end up overriding the functions defined in this module. But
% this module must define the functions we want the NIF to implement.
% Theoretically this won't ever get called as out on_load function init/0
% should raise an error if we have issues.
%
% A really nice person would make a pure Erlang fallback incase a NIF was
% unable to load for a specific platform.

%% Iternal functions

% Since we used init/0 in our -on_load() preprocessor directive, this
% function will get called as the module is loaded. This is the perfect
% place to load up our NIF shared library. Handily, the response of
% erlang:load_nif/2 matches the return specification for -on_load()
% functions.
